An online national clothing chain wants to create a targeted marketing campaign. Sales have been flat and they want to lure lost customers back. They want to advertise specific products to specific customers in specific locations, but they don’t know who to target. They have three products in mind:
Shirt: $25
Sweater: $100
Leather Bag: $1,000
They need you to conduct an analysis to determine the best product to advertise to each customer.

In this project, will be using population statistics from the US Census Bureau to determine where the greatest income exists around the country and whether there is a correlation between sales and income. We don’t know the incomes of our customers, but we should be able to predict it by looking at their purchase history and locations and comparing that against the census data. Additionally, we want to analyze our inventory, specifically customer ratings and return rate and see if there’s a correlation between the two.
